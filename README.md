# EditorCollab

## Hi! What is this?

Editor Collab is a Geometry Dash mod that allows multiple users to edit same levels at the same time with live changes. You can just share a level, and collaborate with other people on your level simultaneously! To access features such as ability to edit the level and even sharing your very own beatiful level visit the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alk1m123). The repository is intended for users to submit bug reports, feature requests, and download releases for Editor Collab. 

## How to use

You can download the client from [releases](https://github.com/altalk23/EditorCollab/releases/latest). If you have [Geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode) set up on Windows, I would recommend using the Geode release, otherwise the standalone setup instructions are given below. For MacOS only Geode release exists, so you will need that.  

For Geode put the .geode file inside the geode/mods/ folder and the mod should start functioning.

For standalone Windows release, follow these steps:
- Extract EditorCollab-Resources.zip
- Move EditorCollab folder into Resources/ folder
- Load EditorCollab-Standalone.dll with a dll injector or a mod loader or whatever you Windows users call it 

Account screen is located in the same place as the Geometry Dash account screen, press the "TE" button to access. 

The button on the top left side of the created levels screen is the enter level button, you need to enter the 8 letter code you are provided in order to join a level. If you are a host user, you will also see a button at the top left side of the level info screen, shaped like a download button. That allows you to join into your hosted level and save it to local.
